# Chess Game

This is a chess game system to be played in the terminal developed entirely in Java for my study and learning.






## How it works
The chess game works via a terminal and can be played by up to 2 players.

The system consists in a 8x8 board with black and white pieces and each one has a especific movement possibility that can be highlighted on the board as soon as the player of the round selects the desired piece to move.

The system also counts with some special moves like Promotion and En Passant. It was built according to the following UML diagram:
